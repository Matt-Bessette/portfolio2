					The Education department conceptualized an application that took video filmed in active classrooms and presented it into lessons. The core topic was determined for a module, film was taken in the classrooms related to the education topic, and the module was built according to the indicators designated by the Education department content creators. The front end activities included 'absorb' where the student watches a few videos, then follows up with a 'matching' activity to test their knowledge on the topics. The other activities included a 'true/false' quiz and short answer questions. Every attempt and submission made is written to the database for later review by the course coordinator. The students are required to log into the application with a premade account using their email address provided when they signed up for the course. The accounts are also tied to their student ID for easy reference by the course coordinators.<br><br>

					Technology used in this application includes PHP5 for backend matching and quiz correction, API access from administrative tools, as well as handler to the database to store the data. MySQL for the database engine. JavaScript for administrative tools. Apache2 for web server host.
